# My stance against Minecraft 1.8 modding
I will no longer be developing Minecraft mods
for game version **1.8**. This version is well
over 6 and a half years old, meaning it uses old
standards and an old codebase. The game is also
riddled with bugs and is incredibly unoptimized.
Most of the issues above, however, have been fixed
by mods such as Patcher by Sk1er LLC. The main
reasons I have for disregarding the game version
altogether is the community. The modding and player
communities are toxic beyond belief and are incredibly
malicious in their actions. If needed, I give full
permission for anything I make to be forked and
remade for earlier versions of the game. I will not
be creating official implementations for these
legacy versions.

I'd like to thank everyone who has supported
me in my adventures of being a legacy
Minecraft modder. The support was unreal,
and it was truly amazing to work with some
of the people I did when I was embarking
on my long journey. ‚ù§Ô∏è
